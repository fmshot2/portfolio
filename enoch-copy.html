      <!-- Chapter 1 -->
      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.1</span> These are the words of the blessing of Enoch, with which he blessed the chosen and righteous who will be present on the day of tribulation, when all the wicked and godless are to be removed.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.2</span> And Enoch, a righteous man whose eyes were opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in Heaven, which the Angels showed me. And from them I heard everything, and I understood what I saw; but not for this generation, but for a distant generation that will come.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.3</span> Concerning the chosen I spoke, and I uttered a parable concerning them: The Holy Great One will come forth from His dwelling.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.4</span> And the eternal God will tread from there upon Mount Sinai, and He will appear with His host, and will appear in the strength of His power from Heaven.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.5</span> And all will be afraid, and the Watchers will shake, and great fear and trembling will seize them, to the ends of the earth.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.6</span> And the high mountains will be shaken, and the high hills will be made low, and will melt like wax in the flame.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.7</span> And the earth will sink, and everything that is on the earth will be destroyed, and there will be judgment upon all, and upon all the righteous.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.8</span> But for the righteous, He will make peace, and He will keep safe the chosen, and mercy will be upon them. They will all belong to God, and will prosper and be blessed; the light of God will shine upon them.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.9</span> And behold! He comes with ten thousand holy ones, to execute judgment upon them, and to destroy the wicked, and to contend with all flesh concerning everything that the sinners and the wicked have done and wrought against Him.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Chapter 2 -->
      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.1</span> Contemplate all the events in the sky; how the lights in the sky do not change their courses, how each rises and sets in order, each at its proper time, and they do not transgress their law.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.2</span> Consider the earth and understand from the work that is done upon it; from the beginning to the end, that no work of God changes and becomes corrupt.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.3</span> Consider the summer and the winter; how the whole earth is full of water, and clouds and dew and rain rest upon it.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Chapter 3 -->
      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.1</span> Contemplate and see how all the trees appear withered and all their leaves are stripped – with the exception of the fourteen trees, which are not stripped, but the old leaves remain until the new come after two or three years.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Chapter 4 -->
      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.1</span> And, again, contemplate the days of summer; how at its beginning the Sun is above it. You seek shelter and shade because of the heat of the Sun, and the earth burns with scorching heat, and you cannot tread upon the earth or upon a rock, because of its heat.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Chapter 5 -->
      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.1</span> Contemplate how the trees are covered with green leaves and bear fruit; and understand, in respect of everything, and perceive how He who lives forever made all these things for you.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.2</span> And how His works are before Him in each succeeding year, and all His works serve Him and do not change; but as God has decreed, so everything is done.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.3</span> And consider how the seas and rivers together complete their tasks.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.4</span> But you have not persevered in, nor observed, the Law of the Lord. But you have transgressed and have spoken proud and hard words with your unclean mouth against His greatness. Oh, hard-hearted, you will not have peace!</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.5</span> And therefore you will curse your days, and the years of your life will perish. And the years of your destruction will be multiplied in eternal execration, and you will not receive mercy.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.6</span> In those days you will make your names an eternal curse to all the righteous, and they will curse you sinners forever.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.7</span> And for you, the chosen, the righteous will rejoice; and your names will be blessed forever and ever.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.8</span> The Lord will aid the righteous and will give them light, and they will live forever. And sin and darkness will perish forever, and will not be seen again from then on forevermore.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Chapter 6 -->
      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 6</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.1</span> And it came to pass, when the sons of men had increased, that in those days there were born to them fair and beautiful daughters.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.2</span> And the Angels, the sons of Heaven, saw them and desired them. And they said to one another: "Come, let us choose for ourselves wives, from the children of men, and let us beget, for ourselves, children."</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.3</span> And Shemihazah, who was their leader, said to them: "I fear that you may not wish this deed to be done, and that I alone will pay for this great sin."</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.4</span> And they all answered him and said: "Let us all swear an oath, and bind one another with curses, so not to alter this plan but to carry out this plan effectively."</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.5</span> Then they all swore together and all bound one another with curses, to it.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.6</span> And they were, in all, two hundred, and they came down on Ardis which is the summit of Mount Hermon. And they called the mountain Hermon, because on it they swore and bound one another with curses.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.7</span> And these are the names of their leaders: Shemihazah, who was their leader, Artaqoph, Rameel, Kokabel, Tamiel, Ramiel, Daniel, Ezeqel, Baraqiel, Asael, Hermoni, Matarel, Ananel, Satoel, Shamsiel, Sahriel, Tummiel, Turiel, Yomiel, Yezeqiel.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.8</span> These are the leaders of the two hundred Angels, and of all the others with them.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Chapter 7 -->
      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 7</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.1</span> And they took wives for themselves, and everyone chose for himself one each. And they began to go into them, and were promiscuous with them, and they taught them charms and spells, and they showed them the cutting of roots and trees.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.2</span> And they became pregnant and bore large giants. And their height was three thousand cubits.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.3</span> These devoured all the toil of men, until men were unable to sustain them.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.4</span> And the giants turned against them in order to devour men.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.5</span> And they began to sin against birds, and against animals, and against reptiles, and against fish, and they devoured one another's flesh and drank the blood from it.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.6</span> Then the earth complained about the lawless ones.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Chapter 8 -->
      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 8</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.1</span> And Azazel taught men to make swords, and daggers, and shields, and breastplates. And he showed them the things after these, and the art of making them; bracelets, and ornaments, and the art of making up the eyes, and of beautifying the eyelids, and the most precious stones, and all kinds of coloured dyes. And the world was changed.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.2</span> And there was great impiety, and much fornication, and they went astray, and all their ways became corrupt.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.3</span> Amezarak taught all those who cast spells and cut roots, Armers taught how to resolve spells, Baraqiel taught astrologers, Kokabel taught portents, Tamiel taught astrology, and Asradel taught the path of the Moon.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.4</span> And at the destruction of men, they cried out, and their voices reached Heaven.</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Chapter 9 -->
      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 9</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.1</span> And then Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Phanuel looked down from Heaven and saw much blood being shed on the earth, and all the lawlessness being done on the earth.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.2</span> And they said to one another: "The earth, from the uncleanliness being brought upon it, is crying out even to the gate of Heaven.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.3</span> And now, to you, the Holy Ones of Heaven, the souls of men complain, saying: 'Bring our case before the Most High.'"</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.4</span> And they said to the Lord of the Ages: "Lord of Lords, God of Gods, King of Kings, and God of the Ages, the throne of Your glory endures for all the generations of the ages, and Your Name is holy and glorious, and blessed to all the ages!</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.5</span> You have made everything, and power over everything is Yours. And everything is uncovered, and open, in front of You. And You see everything, and nothing can be hidden from You.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.6</span> See then what Azazel has done; how he has taught all iniquity on the earth and revealed the eternal secrets that are made in Heaven.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.7</span> And Shemihazah has made known spells, he to whom You gave authority to rule over those who are with him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.8</span> And they went into the daughters of men together, lay with those women, became unclean, and revealed to them these sins.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.9</span> And the women bore giants, and thereby the whole earth has been filled with blood and iniquity.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.10</span> And now behold, the souls which have died, cry out and complain unto the gate of Heaven, and their groaning has ascended, and they cannot get out from in front of the face of the lawlessness which is being committed on the earth.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.11</span> And You know everything, before it happens, and You know everything, and what they do, and yet You do not speak to us. What ought we to do with them about this?"</div>
      </div>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 10</h3>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.1</span> And then the Most High, the Great and Holy One, spoke, and sent Arsyalalyur to the son of Lamech, and said to him:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.2</span> "Say to him in My Name; hide yourself! And reveal to him the end which is coming, because the whole earth will be destroyed. A deluge is about to come on all the earth, and all that is in it will be destroyed.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.3</span> And now teach him so that he may escape, and his offspring may survive for the whole Earth."</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.4</span> And further the Lord said to Raphael: "Bind Azazel by his hands and his feet, and throw him into the darkness. Split open the desert which is in Dudael, and throw him there.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.5</span> And throw on him jagged and sharp stones, and cover him with darkness. And
